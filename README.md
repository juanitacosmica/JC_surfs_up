# JC_surfs_up
Module 9: Surfs Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval!

# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to obtain more information about temperature trends before opening a surf shop in Hawaii. This will show the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business are sustainable year-round.

Two parts are accomplished through this analysis:

- D1: Summary Statistics for June
- D2: Summary Statistics for December
- D3: Bonus! showing the precipitation for June and December by year

# Resources:
 
 **Data source** All data used and queries used in this analysis are available in the [Repo Folder](https://github.com/juanitacosmica/JC_surfs_up) and all sample images of the results are in the [Resources Folder](https://github.com/juanitacosmica/JC_surfs_up/Resources)

  **Software** Juyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.


# Results:

The analysis allowed us to see how the temperatures and precipitations are not very distant from each other when comparing June (D1) and December (D2), even when seeing the rain for these months year after year between 2010 and 2017 (D3).

All data results are avaialble for viewing on the [Resources Folder](https://github.com/juanitacosmica/JC_surfs_up/Resources).

# Summary:

From the previous results, it can be seen that there is not such a huge difference between these two months, quite steady temperatures and few showers as per the data.

Eventhough it was seen significant amount of rain in 2010 for December, as of 2011, both December and June remained similar until 2017.

It would not seem like a bad idea for our client to open the surf and ice cream shop. Recommendation IAW to the weather analysis above is to Go Ahead!
